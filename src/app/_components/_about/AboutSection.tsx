                            I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in web development, full-stack engineering,
                            distributed systems, and micro-services. My experience in software development encompasses
                            various
                            aspects of engineering, and I thrive on solving complex problems and building robust solutions.

                            Beyond my professional expertise, I have a deep passion for music and music production.

                            into the music industry. I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth in both the software
                            development field and the world of music.
