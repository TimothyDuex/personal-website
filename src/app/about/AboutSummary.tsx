          Hey, I’m Tim! I’m a software developer by trade. Outside of work, I
          love DJing and producing music. Running, health, and wellbeing are
          also a big part of my life. In the winter, you’ll usually find me
          snowboarding. When it’s time to relax, I enjoy some light gaming.
